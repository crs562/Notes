# Evolution of Microservices

## Monolithic Architecture
* Monolithic architecture is very similar to joint families. All components are present together in one box and all data stored in one database.

## Monolithic Pros
1. Simplicity
* Families have a well-defined structure, rules and shared responsibility which makes completing tasks easier.
* As it is normally owned by a single team, authority is centralized and technology is compatible it is easy to develop and build.
2. Performance
* Every member of a family knows his role and responsibility. Being together makes them strong to give better performance.
* Close proximity and optimized design to the application needs gives best performance in the context.
3. Horizontal Scaling
* As a family grows, more rooms are created in the same space and new members are accommodated.
* Applications can be easily scaled horizontally by adding new hardware and running new instances.
4. Maintainability
* Every one contributes to the same pool and consumes what family produces.
* Maintaining a single application is simples them multiple ones due to knowledge of it and control over it.

## Monolithic Cons
1. Flexibilty
2. Responsiveness
3. Availability
